## jhste compatibility

- Repo-local instructions remain authoritative.
- Use `jhste-engineering-judgment` for scope, seams, assumptions, and failure paths when it applies.
- Vocabulary in this vendored skill is advisory unless adopted by repo-local docs; do not rename established repo concepts only to match this skill.
- File, repo, command, issue, PR, or other external side effects require explicit approval unless the user already requested that exact side effect.


Interview me relentlessly about every aspect of this plan until we reach a shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one. For each question, provide your recommended answer.

Ask the questions one at a time.

If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead.
